# Flash Card Linked PDF A5

An A5-sized (perfect for a Boox Go 10.3) linked PDF with flash cards.
My LaTeX is terrible, I haven't used it in 20+ years. ChatGPT helped a
lot, but then I hand adjusted a few things.

If its worth investing more time in, I'd create A4, A5, and A6 versions
maybe with 50, 100 or 250 cards so people could pick, but for now this
works for me. Contributions welcome for sure.
